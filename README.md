Black Mamba
=======

A collection of algorithms and data structures that can be used to boost the performance of your Java applications.

This project is inspired by the fact that the Java Collections library only offers basic data structures and algorithms. Performance can be an issue, and sometimes it becomes necessary to resort to some pretty advanced methods that tend to be discussed only in algorithms textbooks. It is hoped that by providing implementations of these esoteric routines that developers might find a use for them in their projects.
